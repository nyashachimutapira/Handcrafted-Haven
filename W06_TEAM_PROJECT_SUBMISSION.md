**Success 2:** [Add your second success]
- Impact: [What positive outcome resulted]

### Insights Gained
**Insight 1:** Separation of concerns between frontend and backend enables better testing and debugging
- Applied to: Our architecture decision to deploy frontend to Vercel and backend to Render
- Future application: Will continue this practice for scalability

**Insight 2:** [Add your second insight]
- Applied to: [How this was applied]
- Future application: [How we'll use this going forward]

### Decisions Made
1. **Architecture:** Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Render, Single PostgreSQL database
2. **Tech Stack:** Next.js + React for frontend, Express.js for backend, Prisma ORM
